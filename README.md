# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:
To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities.
## Algorithm:
1.Define Problem
Identify the user experience problem or feature to improve.

2.Solution Ideation
Brainstorm multiple ideas and solutions.

Use techniques like mind maps, sketches.
Select top ideas based on criteria.

3.Create User Personas
Define target user profiles with goals and pain points.

4.User Story Creation
For each persona, write user stories in the format
“As a [persona], I want to [action], so that [benefit].”
Add acceptance criteria.

5.Scenario Development
Develop realistic scenarios describing how personas use the product.
Contextualize environment, motivations, and challenges.

6.Flow Mapping
Identify key tasks from user stories and scenarios.
Create flowcharts showing step-by-step user interactions.
Note decision points and pain points.

7.Information Architecture Design
Organize content/features into logical groups.
Create site maps or hierarchical structures.
Use card sorting or tree testing for validation.

8.Review and Iterate
Review outputs with stakeholders or users.
Iterate designs based on feedback.

## Output:
1. Solution Ideation (Crazy 8s / Brainwriting)
Problem: Booking a train ticket in a railway app is confusing and slow.
Crazy 8s – 8 Fast Ideas
1.	Single Search Bar: Type “Chennai to Bangalore tomorrow” → auto-finds trains.
2.	Smart Filters: Shows cheapest, fastest, and least-crowded options instantly.
3.	Live Seat Map: Click seats visually instead of dropdown numbers.
4.	Quick Book: 1-tap booking for frequent routes (“Home ↔ College”).
5.	AI Suggestion: Suggests best train based on time, price, and crowd level.
6.	PNR Prediction: Before booking, shows chances of confirmation (High/Medium/Low).
7.	Voice Search: Say “Book a train to Delhi tonight.”
8.	Group Booking: Auto-select seats together for families/friends.
Low-Fidelity Flow
Home → Search Route → Select Train → Choose Class → Select Seat → Passenger Details → Pay → Ticket Confirmation

2. User Stories (5 Stories)
1.	As a frequent traveler, I want to quickly search trains by route, so that I don’t waste time navigating menus.
2.	As a budget-conscious user, I want to see the cheapest options first, so that I can save money.
3.	As a family user, I want seats to be suggested together, so that we can sit as a group.
4.	As a first-time user, I want a simple and clear booking process, so that I do not feel confused.
5.	As an urgent traveler, I want confirmation probability (PNR prediction), so that I know if I should book or choose another train.
3. Scenario (Train Ticket Booking Example)
       User Story Used : “As a frequent traveler, I want to quickly search trains by route so that I don’t waste time.”
Scenario : Rahul, a 21-year-old student, travels from Bangalore to Chennai often for college breaks. Today, he suddenly needs to go home. He opens the railway app feeling stressed and rushed.
The app shows a simple search bar—Rahul types “Bangalore to Chennai tonight.”
Available trains appear instantly with clear timings and seat availability.
He feels relieved, selects a train, chooses a window seat, pays, and gets the ticket within minutes.
Rahul ends the process satisfied and confident.
